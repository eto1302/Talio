# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Martin
Minute taker: Cristiana

Mark: Pass

Feedback: A chairman and minute taker were selected before the meeting


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: Some elements of the template were skipped over. Not necessarily bad, but I'd prefer if you just add them, even if it is just a minute. Also add the agenda to repo before the meeting. Also, preferably try to keep the topic descriptions in the agenda short.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Check last weeks feedback for the minute taker. From this week onwards we give feedback on last weeks minutes


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The chair led the meeting very well. All topics were covered in an appropriate amount of time, although the topics were not very concise making it a bit harder to judge


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: The atmosphere in the group was good and the team defenitely took ownership of the meeting well. I would like to hear some more from some of the team members, so that everyone gets their opinion in.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Make sure to make this a standard topic in the agenda.
