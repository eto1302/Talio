# Backlog

### Submission

Mark: Fail

Feedback: The file is in the wrong subfolder. This is not a big deal of course, but just make sure to read the assignment (including the hand-in part) carefully.


### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback: All the structural parts are included, although some mock ups would be nice.


### Epics

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: User stories should be split up into epics. These are currently not present.


### User Stories

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: All the user stories are nicely formatted and are written from the users perspective. Try to find some more gaps which could fit another user story.


### Acceptance Criteria

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The user stories are of good length. Some stories could do with some more clear and measurable acceptance criteria.
