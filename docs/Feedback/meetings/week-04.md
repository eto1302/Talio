# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Chair and minute taker were chosen beforehand


#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The agenda followed the template and the points on the agenda were clear. Try to improve time estimates again for next week.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: The amount of notes is on the lower side. The notes are clear and concise. Also it would be preferable to merge the notes into the agenda file instead of having two different ones.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Not all topics in the agenda were covered. Just like last week the topics from the template were skipped. Take note of this. Aside from that the whole team led the meeting instead of the chairman this week. This went fine, but I would lik the chairman to take more of a leading role.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The overal atmosphere in the group is really good. The team took full ownership of the meeting and most people were involved in the discussion. I would like the rest to invite the people who talk less into the conversation.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: What was done this week was mentioned, but for next week show me what has been done instead. Really get started coding this week!!!
