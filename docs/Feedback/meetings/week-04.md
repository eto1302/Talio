# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The chair and minute taker were selected beforehand


#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The agenda followed the template and the agenda points were clear. For next week make the time estimates more realistic


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: A good amount of notes were created. Some notes could be more clear, by writing them out better. For example *Testing -> Mockito* could be changed to *For tests that need to use mocks we can use Mockito to make the creation of mocks easier* 


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: The chair led the meeting in the sense that they asked the questions. I believe these meetings could be used to have discussions, but instead it was just a few questions. This is fine, but maybe try to think of something to have a good meeting about 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The atmosphere in the group was really good. Everyone was listened to and it was very respectful. For next time I would like to see more people be included in the conversation from time to time.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback: Everyone did a small stand up at the beginning. I would like to see all the progress for the week merged into main and shown to me on one computer.
