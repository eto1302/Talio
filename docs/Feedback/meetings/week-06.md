# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The chair and minute taker were selected beforehand


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda is nice and clear and it follows the provided template. Next time, make sure to upload the agenda to gitlab on time, also try to make the agenda items more realistic. They do not have to be multiples of 5 minutes.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: Very comprehensive notes were taken and they were nicely merged into the agenda.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: The chair should keep the meeting on track a little more when the conversation diverges from the agenda.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The attitude in the group is constructive and overal very positive. Some people are not as involved in the discussion and others. I would like the others to involve these people more


#### Potentially Shippable Product
