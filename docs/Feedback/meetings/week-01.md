#### 1) Self-organization
_Excellent_

The team had no problem being in charge of the meeting, aside from some explanations from my end. A few minutes after starting the meeting students already started taking their own initiative. Some people did take charge more and talk more than others. The tone of the meeting was very respectful and I saw some admiration in between the group members as well. For next time some people should maybe invite others to talk a little more, but it is a very small complaint.


#### 2) Suggested Topics
_Good_

All the suggested topics were covered. The team seemed to be quite well prepared considering this is the first week. For next week they need to read through the teamwork lecture to inform themselves of the role of a chairman and minutetaker and more general info about how to work as a ateam. The team moderated the meeting quite well after a little start up from my end. The only thing the team needs to do to improve is read up a little more.
