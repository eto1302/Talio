# Code Contributions and Code Reviews

#### Focused Commits

Grade: Excellent

Feedback: The commits all look really good. The messages are clear and the number of files affected is reasonable.


#### Isolation

Grade: Excellent

Feedback: Feature branches and merge requests were used nicely!


#### Reviewability

Grade: Very Good

Feedback: The MRs are really clear and you made good use of the descriptions. The only thing I would like to see is that people assign themselves or others to the MRs


#### Code Reviews

Grade: Very Good

Feedback: MRs are reviewed very timely which is really nice. I would like to see the comments be a bit more discussion-oriented. They should lead to improvements in the code.


#### Build Server

Grade: Very Good

Feedback: The builder server failed a few times too many. Build failures did get quickly resolved!
