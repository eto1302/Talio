# Code Contributions and Code Reviews

#### Focused Commits

Grade: Good

Feedback: The commit messages are concise and descriptive. I would make them more granular, meaning that the changes are smaller per commit. Furthermore, make sure that everyone really starts coding this week! 


#### Isolation

Grade: Good

Feedback: Feature branches have been used. I would suggest keeping a clear naming scheme for the branch names. For example *issue_number*-*description_of_issue_in* or whatever you think is best. I would suggest making use of a development branch as well


#### Reviewability

Grade: Very Good

Feedback: The names and scopes of the MRs are good. 


#### Code Reviews

Grade: Good

Feedback: Make sure to really spend time doing code reviews and be sure to be critical about other peoples code. Write clear comments with good exmples/screenshots/explanations


#### Build Server

Grade: Insufficient

Feedback: You have not yet added 10+ checkstyle rules. Be sure to do this as soon as posible. Also be sure to not push too much and instead do a few commits and push when you are done. This stops the pipeline from running continuously
