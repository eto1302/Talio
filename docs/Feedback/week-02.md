## Formative Assessment


#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Cristiana
Minute taker: Miia

Mark: Pass

Feedback: A chair and minute taker were selected before the meeting


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda was delivered a day or two before the meeting, so defenitely on time. It followed the template, the only problem was that the times did not match up to the actual times of the meeting.
Although this is excusable as the agenda was sent before the time was changed. 

#### Chair performance

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Some of the topics at the beginning of the meeting were skipped. The rest of the agenda was followed well. Make sure to only put things in the agenda that you will actually by covering.

#### Time management

Mark: Good

Feedback: The times for all the agenda points were quite well estimated, although it can still be improved. There was enough time for all the topics. 
Plan only the time that you actually need, you don't have to fill the whole timeslot.

#### Minute taker performance

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The number of minutes were fine. I believe that not all of the important decisions in the meeting were written down though. 
The minutes contain questions that were asked, but not the actual answers for example.

#### Relation

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Most people were involved in the meeting. I would like to see the chair invite the people who are speaking less to talk. The tone of the meeting was respectful and nice, so it was all good!
